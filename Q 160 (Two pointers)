        In the second iteration, the pointer pA and pB must meet for the reason below:
        in the first iteration, pA is asked to travel L1 + Lc where L1 is the distance between headA and intersection         point, LC is the distance
        from the intersection point to the end of A linked list,
        and pB is asked to travel L2 + Lc, where Lc is the common part A linked list and linkned list both share.
        For the second iteration, pA is asked to travel L2, and pB is asked to travel L1,
        so, they will travel exact the same distance before they meet each other at the intersection point
